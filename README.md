# Hello C
This example project is written in C, and tested with make and bash scripts.

### The assignment
The tests are currently failing because we're printing the wrong string. Correcting the `printf` will fix the tests.



1. Log in to GitHub in VS Code by clicking the user icon in the bottom left corner (above gearbox). In the VSCode terminal, clone the repo to your local machine using the repo URL obtained while accepting the assignment.  
```sh
     git clone <your-repo-url>
```
2. Make changes to files and test your changes locally using

```sh
make test
```

3. commit your changes to the GitHub repo by running
  ```sh
   git add hello.c
   git commit -m "<commit message>"
   git push origin master
  ```
    
4. For seeing the logs/cmd line output of auto-grading:   
   Go to your repo URL > open the actions tab > click latest workflow run > autograding


# Using Git

We just need very basic knowledge of git. You may go over the links bellow.

- [Git Videos](https://git-scm.com/videos)
- [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/): You can go over chapters 1,2,3 (mostly we will only need 2).

# Using Make

You will not be needing much knowledge of make for the project, since the makefile is already given to you. You will
not be required to change it unless you are doing something very advanced. The following reference is provided to help you understand how it works. Knowing it would be helpful in the future.
